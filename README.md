# Power Cooks

I heard about [astrojs](https://astro.build/) long ago but never had the chance to try it to create a static website. This is a very simple project i tired out astro. I also used [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/).

[Demo of the project](https://buraky-powercooks.netlify.app/).
